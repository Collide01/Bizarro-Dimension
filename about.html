    <h1>Space Invaders: The Bizarro Dimension</h1>
    <h1>Journal Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Process:</h2>
    <p><b>11/23/20: </b>This is made as a class project. Since Space Invaders is similar to one of the demo projects, I think I
        will reuse some of the functions from that project and modify them. I plan on using keyboard controls instead of
        mouse controls, so I have to find out how to do that. I also have to find reference images to pull the sprites
        from. I'm not focused on the sounds right now, so I'll work on that some other time. I can picture the coding
        process for this project being divided into two parts: the setup phase (a.k.a. the slog), and the creative
        design phase. The slog will consist of adding in all the sprites and adding basic functionality to everything so
        all the code later on will be as simple as plugging in functions and using variables. The creative design phase
        will mainly involve designing the levels and focusing entirely on making the levels work. I just know the slog
        will be extremely tedious and boring, so I want to get that done as soon as possible.</p>
    <p><b>11/24/20: </b>I'm starting to get a solid idea of how I want to structure this project. The ultimate plan is
        to have levels 1 and 7 be the same while the rest of the levels are randomly selected from a pool. For now, I
        will have specific levels for the prototype and I'll convert those levels to the pool once the prototype is
        done. Today, I created many different scenes for the game and loaded in the sprites. Since there will be
        intermission scenes that tell the story and tell you what you need to know for the level, there will definitely
        be more than just a start scene, a game scene, and a game over scene.</p>
    <p><b>11/25/20: </b>Today, I added keyboard controls so I can move the cannon. I made it so some levels will let you
        move up and down while others won't. I also decided to have all the aliens be spritesheets since they will be
        animated and there's a loop variable for them. This means I don't have to create two different versions of every
        alien and have twice the amount of assets. I'm also starting to think of cool ideas for a boss battle, but that
        will definitely be the most difficult level to make. I'll have that as a stretch goal for the prototype.</p>
    <p><b>11/26/20: </b>Today is Thanksgiving. Since I'll be spending a lot of time hanging out with family, I will
        spend much less time on this project today, but I will still try to get as much done as possible. Today, I added
        the aliens into the game scene and made them move and be able to be shot. Since Levels 1 and 3 are similar in
        this regard, I tackled both of them at once. I made the barriers and the alien lasers and added functionality to
        them. I also discovered that I can use the color of objects to trigger events, but in order for the colors to
        look right, the sprites have to be white or grayscaled. This isn't a problem for me since all of my sprites are
        mostly one color.</p>
    <p><b>11/27/20: </b>Today, I made explosion effects for the assets so it looks like there's impact when something is
        shot and I made the scenes properly change when you win or lose. I also took this opportunity to spice up the
        scenes so they don't look so plain. Now that I got this done, I'm finally out of the slog and onto the fun part
        of this project: the creative design phase. During testing, I realized that the collision box for the
        cannon makes it look like you die if the lasers don't even touch you. So I made a custom hitbox for the cannon
        to prevent this. I'm starting to get even more ideas for the boss battle, and now I'm considering having RNG
        decide between two different types of boss battles against the same boss. I hope I'm not overscoping this
        project.</p>
    <p><b>11/28/20: </b>Today, I created Level 2. This involved having the aliens move in a circle while always facing
        towards the center of the stage and firing lasers towards the center too. This required a lot of knowledge of
        geometry, and what I learned about moving objects in a circle in Interactive Media Development definitely helped
        too. I also changed the code that helped me use custom fonts by using another external tool: the Google WebFont
        API. I decided to use this instead of a CSS file because it was random whether the font was loaded or not, and I
        didn't want that. Also, I'm starting to find it very difficult to scroll through my main JavaScript file, since
        there is over 1000 lines of code now. I often find myself having to minimize some of the functions just to be
        able to scroll through the code faster.</p>
    <p><b>11/29/20: </b>Today, I imported audio into my game. Some audio fits with the game, and others just kind of
        come out of nowhere, and that's the point. I used random sound effects and music off of the internet and from
        YouTube. All of which are listed in the references. I'm also finally starting development on the boss battle,
        which I will call Boss Bizarro. So far, I added a functioning health bar to correspond with a health variable. I
        was planning on getting more done today, but I ended up procrastinating. I'll make sure that doesn't happen
        again.</p>
    <p><b>11/30/20: </b>I spent all day today working on Boss Bizarro. So far, I created his basic 3 lasers attack and
        his beam attack. I also reworked Level 2 so the aliens look more organized. I was getting a bug where the level
        was unbeatable sometimes if the game registers the wrong alien when you shoot it. That's why I changed the level
        like this, and honestly, I like it better like this. Since the prototypes are due tomorrow, I want to finish the
        boss battle tomorrow and add any final touches to the game before I submit it. Also, is it wrong to
        procrastinate by playing the game that you're making? I find myself having too much fun playing this goofy game.
    </p>
    <p><b>12/1/20: </b>I gave Boss Bizarro another attack where he snaps his fingers and gives the player a random
        status effect. With that, Boss Bizarro is all finished for the prototype. I finalized everything and ironed
        out the details and got rid of some extra bugs. I also added a pre-title scene because Chrome doesn't allow
        autoplay for audio and it screws up the title screen.</p>
    <p><b>12/2/20: </b>I didn't work on the game at all today because I was busy working on an assignment for another
        class. Tomorrow, I should be able to continue working on the game.</p>
    <p><b>12/3/20: </b>Back at it again with this project. I did a lot of minor tweaks to improve the
        overall quality of the game thanks to the feedback I received from the professor and other students. I also
        designed the site page itself to give it the atmosphere that I'm trying to show in the game. Most of all, I
        completely restructured the game by adding the middle levels to the RNG pool so now all of the middle levels
        show up in random orders. It also opened the way to add more levels into the game. I decided to make these extra
        levels focus on the different status effects that can occur on you. The only one that's not given a level is the
        one where you turn pink because that's a Boss Bizarro exclusive status effect.</p>
    <p><b>12/4/20: </b>I spent a lot less time on this game today because I was taking my Calculus finals. But I did
        work on some of the extra levels. So far, I made two new levels: Hijack and Dark Destruction. Hijack focuses on
        the status effect where your controls are reversed, and the level itself is really weird. Dark Destruction is
        made so you fight in a dark atmosphere where you can't see anything. There are occasional lightning strikes that
        temporarily light up the place.</p>
    <p><b>12/5/20: </b>Today is the last day to work on this project, and I went full force. I created the rest of the
        levels, added music to every level, fixed a ton of bugs and glitches along the way, and added some visual flare
        for defeating the boss, as well as updating the win scene because this isn't the prototype anymore. There are a
        lot of things I came up with in my proposal that I didn't implement, but I think this game is fine without
        them. I think this project is all good to go now. As of this day, Space Invaders: The Bizarro Dimension is
        finally complete!</p>

    <h2>How the requirements were met:</h2>
    <h3>A. Functional</h3>
    <p>Since I wanted to make Space Invaders, Circle Blast already laid the groundwork for me, so I used that tech stack
        and built my project off of it.</p>
    <p>I wanted the game to be as fun as possible, so a heavy focus was put on controls and difficulty. I made sure that
        the controls weren't clunky and I made sure that the game wasn't too difficult where people don't want to play
        it again but it also wasn't mind-numbingly easy where people get bored. I made sure I accomplished this by
        posting my game in the crit groups and receiving feedback about the game.</p>
    <h3>B. Design and Interaction</h3>
    <p>Since I wanted to recreate Space Invaders, I decided to go with an 8-bit design, mostly. I made sure everything
        fits that aesthetic and nothing looked out of place.</p>
    <p>Since I don't want anyone to be confused about the controls or the status effects, I made sure to explain them
        before each level. But at the same time, I left out enough information so people will be surprised by how each
        level was structured, and especially, how the boss fights.</p>
    <h3>C. Media</h3>
    <p>I pulled some images off the internet and I drew others myself, but I manually cropped and resized all of them to
        make sure they worked properly in the game. I didn't want any hitbox jank whatsoever.</p>
    <p>I have so many sounds in this game that they make up the bulk of this project in terms of data. Each and every
        sound is used to enhance the experience. Sound effects play when they need to and music loops properly. It got
        to the point where having a level without music seemed out of place.</p>
    <p>I did reuse Press Start 2P from Part 4 of Circle Blast because it fit the aesthetic of my game the best, but
        everything else was completely replaced. Despite the fact that I built this game off of Circle Blast, it is
        almost impossible to recognize Circle Blast in this project now.</p>
    <h3>D. HTML/CSS</h3>
    <p>All of the HTML in the game file and this documentation file are validated and the CSS is validated too. The CSS
        is also moved into its own file.</p>
    <h3>E. Code Conventions</h3>
    <p>All of my ES6 classes are located in the classes JavaScript file. They are used to create still sprites and
        rectangles for lasers and hitboxes. All of them are extended to either PIXI.Graphics for basic rectangles or
        PIXI.Sprite for actual sprites.</p>
    <p>I never used any DOM traversal in this project, so there are no uses for querySelector() and querySelectorAll().
    </p>

    <h2>Anything Special:</h2>
    <p>I structured my game so from levels 2 to 6, the levels are randomized. So for example, on your first run, you get
        The Carousel Crew as your second level, but on your second run, you get Hijack as your second level instead. By
        using RNG like this, I also made an extremely hard level, simply called DANGER!, but the chances of getting it
        are very low. You have to be REALLY unlucky to get this level.</p>
    <p>RNG makes up a HUGE portion of this game, and that's all to keep this game from becoming predictable. There are a
        lot of aspects of this game that use RNG. Including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The levels you get</li>
        <li>Which aliens become which colors</li>
        <li>When the aliens attack</li>
        <li>When Boss Bizarro attacks and what attack he uses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of the sounds are pulled from somewhere on the internet, and, as expected, none of them were at the proper
        length that I wanted them to be at. So I had to manually trim these sounds to be the proper length. I also had
        to trim the music so they loop properly.</p>

    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <p>
        The idea behind this game is that it's similar to Space Invaders, where you're
        a little green cannon shooting aliens, but there are a lot of whacky twists that
        set this game apart from the original. Who knows what could happen? You could
        get a crazy powerup for a level, or maybe you'd be playing Galaga all of a sudden.
        Or maybe, just maybe, the level could get so outrageously difficult that enemies
        start moving so fast that they look like blurs as they rain down lasers at you while
        the Pizza Time theme from the Spider-Man 2 video game plays in the background
        because who knows why!
    </p>

    <h2>Genre:</h2>
    <p>Fixed shooter</p>

    <h2>Platform:</h2>
    <p>Desktop only</p>

    <h2>Story:</h2>
    <p>
        Aliens have been trying to invade Earth for the past 15 years, and you've been fighting
        them since the very beginning. With your skills and your laser cannon, Earth has been
        safe with you defending it. However, something different is happening today. A new army
        of aliens arrived, and they teleported you to a different dimension! In this dimension,
        these aliens have full access to their powers, powers that you can't even imagine! Can
        you manage to defeat these aliens and return to Earth?!
    </p>
    <p>
        The player progresses through the game by shooting down waves of aliens. Each level
        represents a wave of aliens, and you have to defeat all of them to progress.
    </p>

    <h2>Aesthetics:</h2>
    <p><b>Graphics style</b>: 8-bit, cartoonish</p>
    <p>
        <b>Sound</b>: 8-bit, looped, occasional sci-fi sound effects similar to ones in Star Wars,
        possibly music from other games
    </p>
    <p><b>Types of sound</b>: effect, UI, background</p>

    <h2>Gameplay:</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Mechanics</b>: The player can move the cannon left and right and fire lasers out of it
        to shoot aliens. Every now and then, powerups could appear and enemies could suddenly become
        extremely dangerous. Weird stuff will usually happen, and that's to mess with the player's
        head.
    </p>
    <p><b>Control</b>: Keyboard</p>
    <p>
        <b>Onboarding</b>: The basic controls are very simple. It is just arrow keys to move left
        and right and space to fire lasers. They will be told this when starting the game. The
        player will be notified when the controls are altered, and they may even be hinted at
        secret button combinations that may or may not give them an advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Player learning</b>: The player needs to learn what is happening around them at all
        times. Powerups will occasionally show up in random levels, like multishot or a temporary
        shield, and they will be helpful. There are no exploits to make the game easy. The only
        strategy is to adapt and overcome.
    </p>

    <h2>Other:</h2>
    <p>
        I plan on using the PIXI API for sprite rendering and control and the Howler API for sounds
        since those were used in the Circle Blast HW.
